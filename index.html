Topic 1: HTML5 APIs (Introduction) & SVG

"HTML5 brought a lot of new capabilities to the browser, often referred to as HTML5 APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). While these APIs primarily use JavaScript to interact with them, HTML provides the elements that enable these interactions. We'll briefly touch on a few, but remember, full implementation requires JavaScript, which is for another course!
Geolocation API: Allows a web page to access the user's current location (with their permission, of course). Think of map applications that show 'you are here.'
Drag and Drop API: Enables elements on a webpage to be dragged and dropped, creating interactive interfaces like file uploads or reordering lists.
Web Storage API (localStorage and sessionStorage): Provides a way for web applications to store data locally within the user's browser. localStorage persists data even after the browser is closed, while sessionStorage clears data when the browser tab is closed. This is useful for saving user preferences or temporary data without sending it to a server.
Canvas API: This is a powerful HTML5 element (<canvas>) that allows you to draw graphics, animations, and even games directly on a webpage using JavaScript. It's like a blank canvas for drawing.
While these APIs use JavaScript, the <canvas> element itself is pure HTML. Let's look at that briefly.
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):
"Unlike the other APIs, SVG isn't a JavaScript API; it's an XML-based markup language for describing two-dimensional vector graphics. What does that mean?
Vector Graphics: SVGs are defined by mathematical equations (paths, shapes, lines) rather than pixels. This means they can be scaled up or down to any size without losing quality or becoming pixelated. Think of logos, icons, or simple illustrations.
Inline in HTML: You can embed SVG code directly into your HTML document!
Let's draw a simple circle using SVG directly in our HTML:"
(Instructor: Open a new file, save it as advanced.html, or add to your existing file.)
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Advanced HTML</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>HTML5 Features</h1>

    <h2>Our First SVG Shape</h2>
    <svg width="100" height="100">
        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
    </svg>

    <h2>Canvas Element (Requires JavaScript to Draw)</h2>
    <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border:1px solid #000000;"></canvas>
    <p>This is a canvas element. We'd use JavaScript to draw on it.</p>

</body>
</html>


"Save and refresh. You should see a yellow circle with a green border. This circle is entirely defined by HTML-like code within the <svg> tag, not an image file!
The <canvas> element is just a blank rectangle. To draw on it, you'd use JavaScript like this (just for demonstration, no need to type this now):
// This would go in a <script> tag later
const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 80, 50);


"This shows how HTML provides the element, and JavaScript provides the functionality."
( Mini-Task )
"In your advanced.html file, try drawing a simple rectangle using SVG. You'll use the <rect> tag with x, y, width, height, fill, and stroke attributes. For example: <rect x="10" y="10" width="80" height="50" fill="blue" stroke="black" />."
